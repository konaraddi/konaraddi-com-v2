I attended the CapitalOne 2018 Software Engineering Winter Summit the past few days. Here's my experience.

Note: I missed the first couple days because I was out of the country.

### 2018.01.09

Learned about:

- [Machine Learning](https://github.com/konaraddio/c1-winter-summit/tree/master/machine-learning/)
  - Jupyter Notebook is really neat
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  - I need to spend more time to understand everything that's going on here
- Amazon Alexa Skills
  - Most people, including me, ran into technical difficulties and were unable to build an Alexa skill
  - Interesting talk nonetheless

Summit attendees went to a Capitals game.

### 2018.01.10

Learned about:

- Bot Development with DialogFlow (in browser)
  - DialogFlow makes it significantly easier to build voice assistants
- [Nessie API](https://github.com/konaraddio/c1-winter-summit/tree/master/nessie/)
  - CapitalOne's mock banking API
- [Android Development](https://github.com/konaraddio/c1-winter-summit/tree/master/android/)
  - Setting up was an ongoing process; there was always something to download

Had lunch with CapitalOne recruiters

- Found out that **~450 applied and only 40 were accepted to this summit**

Summit attendees went bowling at a fancy place near Georgetown Cupcakes.

### 2018.01.11

CapitalOne hosted a summit-wide hackathon, where all summiteers got into teams of 5-6 and hacked together something banking-related for the whole day. Most stayed up past 2:00 AM the next day.

I worked with Max, Kyle, Amy, and Melida to build [SocialSpend](https://github.com/kyle8998/SocialSpend). Max built an iOS app using AR Kit. Kyle and I spent hours being able to read, write, update, and delete data from Firebase but we got it to work eventually. We also restructured the data in Firebase at least 3 times. Kyle, Amy, Melida and I worked on building the desktop website to accompany the iOS app.

### 2018.01.12

Our team was still working on [SocialSpend](https://github.com/kyle8998/SocialSpend) until ~3:30AM. Later, all teams presented their work. The team that won 1st built an app and chrome extension that helps users make better purchases by showing the hidden costs associated with a purchase (e.g. interest, opportunity costs associated with investing).

Personally I thought the most useful hack was [SCRAP.PY](https://github.com/joshseides/microlending). It lets people with no banking information or credit score obtain loans and makes it easy for others to give loans while providing feedback on whether or not it's a good loan to give (using machine learning). This means people who need loans can get them and others can make money by providing loans with a great assurance of being paid back.

The 1st place team won Amazon Echos, but what followed next was a surprise for everyone. Each attendee got to choose from the following:

- Apple TV
- Bose Soundlink speakers
- Beats Powerbeats3
- Phillips Hue

So everyone got a \$150-200 gift. After that surpise, Max said "so we all won". I think we all agreed.

This concluded the CapitalOne 2018 SWE Winter Summit.

### Overall Thoughts

It was a fun summit and I learned a lot during the hackathon. I definitely want to attend more of these types of events and will be looking for more of these corporate summits to attend.
